//Add a getArea method to the Shape class, which returns 0.
//Add a Rectangle class that is derived from the Shape class. 
//The class must have a getArea method that returns the area of the rectangle.
//Similarly to point 1, add a Ellipse class that is derived from the Shape class. 
//Hint: an ellipseâ€™s area is pi * width / 2 * height / 2
//Similarly to point 1, add a Triangle class that is derived from the Shape class
//Create some shapes of each type and call their getArea functions to make sure that your code works.
