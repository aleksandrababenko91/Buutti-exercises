/*Assignment 4
A store is rising the price of a product and is not sure of the result.

Create a program that calculates the result for them: 
have two variables, price and increase. 
Based on these, calculate the final price into a variable named result.

Print the values of all of these variables on their own lines, 
with fitting explanations. For example, "Original price: 6.5".

EXTRA: Print the whole calculation in a single line, like price + increase = result*/


let originalPrice = 20;
let increse = 2.5;

let result = originalPrice * increse;

console.log("Original price: " + originalPrice);
console.log("Increse: " + increse);
console.log("Increse price: " + result);
console.log(originalPrice + "*" + increse + "=" + result);
